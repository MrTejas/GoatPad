# GoatPad

This is a simple Notepad GUI application for text editing purposes. The whole code is written in Java and uses the GUI packages of Java to build the application as it is seen.

The main files in the repository are :-

 - Notepad.java
 - Load.java
 - Save.java


## Features of the Application

The application stores the files in `.txt` format only. It merely acts as an interface between the user and the `.txt` files.  The basic features that the application includes are :-

 1. Creating a New File
 2. Saving a File (with its desired name)
 3. Loading a File into the Editor


## Future Developments 

A bunch of features are to be added to the application. Some of these are :-

 - *Bold, Italic and Underline Features*
 - *Font and Font Size*
 - *Renaming a File*
 - *Shortcut Keys*

## Running the Application
After downloading the repository in the user's machine, the Application can be run be creating an object of the `Notepad` class. A constructor for this task is already created. Depending on the user's platform for running the Application, it can be run by directly creating an object **(as in BlueJ)** or by running these commands in the GoatPad directory of the Windows Powershell.

> javac Notepad.java

> java Notepad

***Note :***  For running the application, JDK is required
